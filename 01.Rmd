00:03:53    Morgan Grovenburg:  I saw the book mentioned a DataEdu Slack Channel (https://dataedu.slack.com/). Is that still going/active?

00:05:10    Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):    Yes it is! It's not as active as R4DS, but there are usually discussions happening.

00:05:10    Isabella Vel√°squez:    Hey Morgan! That‚Äôs is actually where the book got started :) There are lots of people on that Slack. I can send an invite link to join if anybody is interested.

00:05:36    Morgan Grovenburg:  Yes I'm interested in an invite!

00:05:40    Rob Lucas:  Me too!

00:06:12    Isabella Vel√°squez:    Here it is! Let‚Äôs work together in Slack! It‚Äôs a faster, simpler way to talk shop, share files, and get work done. Join here: https://join.slack.com/t/dataedu/shared_invite/zt-9jkexbww-QxFbexhFoanFicVWaEpyBA

00:16:55    beth.kelly: I prefer the camera too! Sorry.

00:18:23    Isabella Vel√°squez:    Thanks Beth! Same here, I often feel siloed and I can‚Äôt wait to learn from all your work.

00:21:10    Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):    r4ds.io/diseur will take you to the bookdown side of the repo, and allow you to hop over to the GitHub (assuming I set it up correctly)

00:22:04    Layla Bouzoubaa:    John I get a 404

00:22:15    Alyssa Ibarra:  Same here

00:22:47    Ryan Woodbury:  https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-dsieur

00:23:19    Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):    Hmmm. Evidently it requires https://r4ds.io/dsieur

00:23:35    Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):    ...which might have just solved a bug I've had elsewhere.

00:24:04    Layla Bouzoubaa:    sweeet

00:28:08    beth.kelly: Jon is freezing for everyone else, right?

00:28:12    Morgan Grovenburg:  Yes

00:30:28    Isabella Vel√°squez:    yeah absolutely. Can‚Äôt wait to get any feedback!!

00:33:12    Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):    My internet is really bad today, gonna drop off!
