00:22:38	Rob Lucas (he/him):	Does anyone have any preferred resources on feature engineering?
00:24:03	Carlo Medina:	I have not done modelling for quite a while. would love to hear resources too, if any.
00:33:05	Mike Haugen:	Max Kuhn
00:33:22	shamsuddeen:	http://www.feat.engineering
00:33:57	Mike Haugen:	I am reading that book now, it is great because it goes beyond the software/code and explains the modeling process, stats a bit.
00:39:13	Mike Haugen:	Max has a book on the caret package as well: http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html
00:39:36	Mike Haugen:	And tidy models: https://www.tmwr.org/
00:40:20	Rob Lucas (he/him):	Wow, he is prolific. Thanks!
00:43:28	Mike Haugen:	Julia Sigle’s video blog has a great example of using random forest with tidy models: https://juliasilge.com/blog/ikea-prices/
00:43:31	shamsuddeen:	http://www.feat.engineering
00:43:36	shamsuddeen:	http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com
00:48:52	Mike Haugen:	Love variable importance; easy for others to understand.
00:54:27	Carlo Medina:	thanks Shamsuddeen!
00:54:30	Mike Haugen:	Thanks!
