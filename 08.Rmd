# Walkthrough 4: Longitudinal Analysis With Federal Students With Disabilities Data

**Learning objectives:**

* Longitudinal analysis uses
* Importing data options
* Processing considerations: what order to take, what to consider for NA's
* Importance of visualizing data
* Considering next steps for modeling analysis

00:41:14	Mike Haugen:	For time series analysis, some of the forecasting functions, e..g exponential smoothing, require a certain approach to dealing with NAs. You can remove NAs for some, for others, you need to impute them
00:42:20	Arami:	Can you explain what "time series analysis" is? Is it any analysis that tracks change over time?
00:43:09	Mike Haugen:	Yes
00:43:48	Mike Haugen:	Like forecasting emergency room presentations based on historical data on emergency room presentations over the last few years
00:44:07	Mike Haugen:	or forecasting course attendance based on historical data.
00:45:18	Rob Lucas:	Glad to know there is some other list-aversion out there!
00:45:27	Mike Haugen:	For R, see Hyndman Forecasting: Principles and Practice: https://otexts.com/fpp3/index.html
00:45:46	Arami:	Thanks!
00:45:47	Ronak Patel:	I also suffer from severe list-aversion.
00:46:33	Morgan Grovenburg:	injuries %>%
  mutate(diag = fct_lump(fct_infreq(diag), n = 5)) %>%
  group_by(diag) %>%
  summarise(n = as.integer(sum(weight)))
