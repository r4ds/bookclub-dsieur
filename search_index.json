This website is being developed by the R4DS Online Learning Community. Follow along, and join the community to participate. This companion follows the R4DS Online Learning Community Code of Conduct. "],["book-club-meetings.html", "Book club meetings", " Book club meetings Each week, a volunteer will present a chapter from the book. This is the best way to learn the material. Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter. More information about how to present is available in the github repo. Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the R4DS Online Learning Community YouTube Channel.

That‚Äôs is actually where the book got started :) There are lots of people on that Slack.

(wearables/fitness trackers) - social media analytics? - tracking personal expenses? - following sports? - ...? - send examples that are similar in purpose/contents/context to what someone is hoping to do ## pedagogical principles embedded in book - walkthroughs helpful for intermediate R user - Could pauses/chances for readers to engage in active thinking/application, instead of spoon feeding the next step be created? - could the bookdown for dsieur-bookclub be a place such walkthroughs could &quot;live&quot;? - education is different/particular - seeing similar data to data that one encounters in one&#39;s work has some benefits (relative to e.g. business data) - the topics are applicable to education - something that could be mentioned - data stored in forms other than CSVs/flat text files - databases/AWS - through dplyr/dbplyr - RStudio connections tab (aside, I [Josh] could never get this to work, but was able to use dbplyr fine) - so many things that we don&#39;t come back to in the text; there are so many features that RStudio is currently working on - for beginning R users - for continuity / expansion of the topic throughout the book - walkthroughs focus on accessing, preparing, creating products from analyses - what about the human aspects of data science? ## teaching strategies - teaching PhD students who have mostly used SPSS, being very contextualized/focusing on a relevant data set can help - visualization is a great place to start - __instead of__ arguing for how access and R (or python or SPSS, etc.) are different, focus on showing how one can do things that one could do in other statistical software - make the transition less abrupt - learn something, step away, and then forget! It would be good to have a systematic way to revisit concepts, like through flashcards - spaced practice, memory, other strategies; easy to let things to too long ## resources - **meta-analysis** or review of when to do what - what strategies are better for teaching what coding/DS concepts and skills? - blocks work really well for certain skills/ideas, but not so well for others - gamification or robotics are common contexts for learning coding/CS - but, there aren&#39;t resources like this for data science (and there aren&#39;t many examples of teaching data science outside of graduate-level courses) - reframe CS activities around data science; could support students moving into data science and machine learning roles (and data-intensive roles in a variety of occupations) - data/data science can be accessible to anyone - personal - in various jobs - not just stem jobs - breaking down misconceptions about what data scientists do/who they are could be a step that could make progress "],["introducing-data-science-tools-to-your-education-job.html", "Chapter 14 Introducing Data Science Tools To Your Education Job", " Chapter 14 Introducing Data Science Tools To Your Education Job Learning objectives: TBD "],["slides-13.html", "14.1 Slides", " 14.1 Slides TBD "],["meeting-videos-13.html", "14.2 Meeting Videos", " 14.2 Meeting Videos 14.2.1 Cohort 1 Meeting chat log 00:30:48 Alyssa Ibarra: Morgan: we have a survey inventory that the Deans annually review.
