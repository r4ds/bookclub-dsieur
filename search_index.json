This website is being developed by the R4DS Online Learning Community. Follow along, and join the community to participate. This companion follows the R4DS Online Learning Community Code of Conduct. "],["book-club-meetings.html", "Book club meetings", " Book club meetings Each week, a volunteer will present a chapter from the book. This is the best way to learn the material. Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter. More information about how to present is available in the github repo. Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the R4DS Online Learning Community YouTube Channel.

That’s is actually where the book got started :) There are lots of people on that Slack. I can send an invite link to join if anybody is interested. 00:05:36 Morgan Grovenburg: Yes I&#39;m interested in an invite! 00:05:40 Rob Lucas: Me too! 00:06:12 Isabella Velásquez: Here it is! Let’s work together in Slack! It’s a faster, simpler way to talk shop, share files, and get work done.

Same here, I often feel siloed and I can’t wait to learn from all your work. 00:21:10 Jon Harmon (jonthegeek): r4ds.io/diseur will take you to the bookdown side of the repo, and allow you to hop over to the GitHub (assuming I set it up correctly) 00:22:04 Layla Bouzoubaa: John I get a 404 00:22:15 Alyssa Ibarra: Same here 00:22:47 Ryan Woodbury: https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-dsieur 00:23:19 Jon Harmon (jonthegeek): Hmmm.

See you soon. 00:37:28 Isabella Velásquez: Yes! And we’ll send a Slack message once we’re done. 00:39:46 Ryan Woodbury: I listened to a podcast about the Kentucky stats project.

Thanks! 00:29:29 Ryan Woodbury: The `mutate_*()` functions are being superseded by using the `across()` function within `mutate()`. 00:30:03 Isabella Velásquez: here&#39;s some documentation on the mutate_* functions. https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate_all.html but like Ryan said, they&#39;ve been superseded. I am still learning across()! 00:30:05 Ryan Woodbury: Line 69 would be: mutate(across(q1:q10, as.numeric)) in the &quot;new&quot; format 00:30:37 Alyssa Ibarra: Thanks, Ryan!
