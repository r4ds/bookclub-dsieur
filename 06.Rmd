# Walkthrough 2: Approaching Gradebook Data From a Data Science Perspective

**Learning objectives:**

Learn about importing excel spreadsheets using a file path or `here()`, tidying data with `clean_names()` and `remove_empty()` from the {janitor} package, transforming data with `pivot_longer()` using `contains()` from the {stringr} package, visualizing data, correlation analysis with `cor()`, and modeling data with `lm()`.

00:24:07	Rob Lucas:	Do you all use {janitor}? The book mentioned that it was developed by an education person, and I wondered if it was used more in education contexts.
00:24:23	Ronak Patel:	clean_names() has changed my life
00:24:26	Alyssa Ibarra:	I have never used it before this.
00:24:39	edgarzamora:	^^^ Ronak +1
00:24:45	Isabella Velásquez:	+1 to clean_names()!
00:25:55	Isabella Velásquez:	{janitor} is by Sam Firke from The New Teacher Project, but I think can be used in any data cleaning context : https://github.com/sfirke/janitor
00:26:34	Mike Haugen:	And then when you create objects, do you make them snake_case?
00:26:38	Mike Haugen:	https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html?q=snake_case#whats-in-a-name
00:27:32	Isabella Velásquez:	usually I do. I only use camelCase in Shiny
00:27:50	edgarzamora:	By default it is snake_case
00:29:56	edgarzamora:	select(-c(absent, late))
00:30:30	Ryan Woodbury:	I do it that way too
00:30:54	Ronak Patel:	same, especially when exploring data. never know what you want to drop and it saves some time.
00:31:18	Isabella Velásquez:	are these xaringan slides? so cool
00:37:38	Rob Lucas:	Why color code those if the boxplots aren't even ordered correctly?
00:38:06	Ronak Patel:	does anyone have a quick way to order them?
00:38:34	edgarzamora:	fct_reorder() maybe?
00:38:58	Ryan Woodbury:	Check out, reorder_within() from tidytext
00:40:03	Ryan Woodbury:	https://juliasilge.com/blog/reorder-within/
00:50:54	Isabella Velásquez:	Awesome job!!!
00:53:38	Ronak Patel:	in a regression, isn't independence of variables an assumption?
00:54:03	Ryan Woodbury:	The errors are independent
00:54:06	Ryan Woodbury:	Should be
00:55:10	Ryan Woodbury:	That is a good question. I want to help find an answer!
00:55:46	Mike Haugen:	Thanks!
